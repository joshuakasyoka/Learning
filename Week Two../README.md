<h2>Notes on Laravel PHP Framework Tutorial</h2>

* SQL Lite used to create databases 
* For example, `vim database/database.sqlite` allows use to create a new file within a database
* To escape database esc `:wq`
* d-flex (flex shortcut) 
* pr-3 (padding right shortcut)
* `php artisan tinker` used to interact with application
* `npm run dev` used to re-run applicaiton on server again 
* `php artisan migrate:fresh` used to update database
* Looking at controllers (i.e /photo /photo/create) (allows us, for example, to grab a single user's profile if we were to choose GET, photo{photo}
* dd stands for "Dump and Die." Laravel's dd() function can be defined as a helper function, which is used to dump a variable's contents to the browser and prevent the further script execution.
* A model: e.g. php artisan make:model : a model represents a table in our database. And one object of a moden represents an actual row in our database
* `php artisan help make:model` allows a definition of the make feature
* Eloquent: database layer of the framework (to fetch queries etc.) Elqouent allows us to run on mySQL and any other database
