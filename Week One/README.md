<h2>Notes</h2>

1. Terminal: open .html (myPage.html) for example will open myPage in browser <br>
2. Terminal: code .html (myPage.html) will run myPage on VCS <br>
3. JavaScript: Template Literals concatenates parts of a function into a single string using back ticks e.g. `key[data-key="${e.keyCode}"]` <br>
4. If I want to select multiple classes I can use (as I wanted to do for multiple cards) `documents.querySelectorAll('.key')` if all the items have the class key <br>
5. If I want to play an audio function `audio.play()` <br>
6. If I want to remove a transition I have made to a class I can use `.remove('playing')` (playing being a set of css rules), likewise I can add this using `.add('playing')` <br>
7. If I want to select each element in an array I can use something like `keys.forEach()` which will select each element in the array 'keys' <br>
8. Getting to grips with `addEventListener('keydown', playSound)` where the function is playSound, and the in " is looking out for event, in this case keydown.) <br>
