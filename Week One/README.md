* Looking at semantic HTML, how to use Terminal, and introducing myself to 'Execute Program', 'JavaScript 30' <br>
* Terminal: open .html (index.html) will open index in browser <br>
* Terminal: code .html (index.hmtl) will run on VCS <br>
* Looking at Template Literals: The default function just concatenates the parts into a single string  with back ticks `key[data-key="${e.keyCode}"]'. <br>
* Useful link for Template Literals https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals <br>
* Link for Git markdown https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
* Link for VCS shortcuts https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf

1. If I want to select multiple classes I can use (as I wanted to do for multiple cards) `documents.querySelectorAll('.key')` if all the items have the class key
2. If I want to play a function `audio.play()`
3. If I want to remove a transition I have made to a class I can use `.remove('playing')` (playing being a set of css rules), likewise I can add this using `.add('playing')
4. If I want to select each element in an array I can use something like `keys.forEach()` which will select each element in the array 'keys' 
5. Getting to grips with `addEventListener('keydown', playSound)` where the function is playSound, and the in " is looking out for event, in this case keydown.)
6. `this.classList`
